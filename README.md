the welcome message : 
👋 **Hey there, future Python pros!** 🐍✨

Welcome to today’s workshop on **Python Programming and Git/GitHub!** 🎉 I’m [Your Name], your guide for this coding adventure, and I’m SO excited to have you here!

🚀 **Get ready to:**

- Unleash the power of Python 🐍 (No actual snakes, I promise!)
- Discover the magic of Git 🤖 (Because who doesn’t love keeping track of all their brilliant ideas?)
- Become a GitHub superstar ⭐ (Where you can brag about your awesome code to the world!)

Don’t worry if you’re new to this – **no one’s born a coding genius**! We're here to learn, laugh, and maybe even break a few things along the way (on purpose, of course 🤓).

Grab your coffee ☕, roll up those sleeves 💪, and let’s dive into the world of code. I promise it’s more fun than it sounds!

# Hand-On Exercises : 

### **1. Python Basics (35 minutes)**

**Exercise:**  
Write a simple program where users input their name and age. The program will then print a message like, “Hello, [Name]! In 5 years, you will be [Age + 5] years old!”
]
**Objective:**  
This introduces variables, data types, and basic I/O (input/output), plus simple arithmetic operations.

---

### **2. Functions in Python (20 minutes)**

**Exercise:**  
Create a function called `calculate_area` that takes the length and width of a rectangle as arguments and returns the area. Then call the function with different values and print the result.

**Objective:**  
Learn how to define and use functions, pass parameters, and return values.

---

### **3. Basic Data Structures in Python (30 minutes)**

**Exercise:**  
Create a simple "to-do list" manager using a list. The user should be able to add tasks, remove tasks, and view the current list. Store each task as a string in a list, and print the list after each operation.

**Objective:**  
Work with lists, adding/removing elements, and printing out lists to the console.

---



### **4 . Final Coding Challenge (30 minutes)**


**Exercise:**  
Create a simple Python program that stores a list of tasks. The program should:

- Allow the user to add a task (a simple string like "buy groceries").
- Allow the user to view all tasks.

Once completed, ask participants to push this project to their GitHub repository and share the link with the class.

**Objective:**  
Combine Python concepts (lists, dictionaries, functions) with Git skills (committing, pushing to GitHub), creating a small but complete project.
